Preparing for what can be Difficult to Predict
```
We juggle many things in our daily lives, which can sometimes cause us to overlook things that are much simpler.  
"Do I need an umbrella?"  
A very simple question, but if forgotten, it can potentially ruin your day.  In this project, a weather dashboard is created to give the user the current weather in addition to a five day forecast.  It also keeps track of search history in case the user wishes to quickly revisit the conditions of a recently viewed city.
